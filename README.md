# Psychic-Game
## This project operates like a typical game of hangman. You start by guessing a letter, and if you choose correctly the letter appears at the position in which it appears in the word. You win by guessing all the letters correctly.

## The importance of this project is it's ability to keep people entertained.

## Evann Henderson maintains this project and is its only contributor.
